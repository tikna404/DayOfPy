## Introduction

This project provides a simple way to work with dates using Python. You can calculate the number of days spent from a specified date and find a specific date in a year by entering the day number.

## Features

- **Days Spent Calculator**: Calculate how many days have passed since a given date.
- **Date Finder**: Find the exact date in any year by entering the day number (e.g., the 100th day of 2024).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for this project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tikna404/days-calculator.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Numbers of Days
cd nth day of the year
```
 ## Usage
 #### Days Spent Calculator
To calculate the number of days spent from a given date, run the Numbers of Days.py script:
 ```bash
 python Numbers of Days.py
 ```
The script will prompt you to enter a date in the format `DD-MM-YYYY`. It will then calculate and display the number of days that have passed since that date.
## nth day of the year
### Date Finder
To find the exact date in any year by entering the day number, run the `nth day of the year.py` script:
 ```bash
 python nth day of the year.py
 ```
